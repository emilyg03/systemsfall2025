## 1. Basic Struct Definition and Usage

In Rust, a struct is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct LLMAgent {
    name: String,
    model: String,
    temperature: f32,
    max_tokens: usize,
}

fn main() {
    let agent = LLMAgent {
        name: String::from("Claude"),
        model: String::from("Sonnet 3.5"),
        temperature: 0.7,
        max_tokens: 150,
    };

    println!("Agent: {:?}", agent);
}
```

## 2. Implementing Methods for Structs

Methods are functions associated with a struct. They're defined within `impl` blocks.

```rust
impl LLMAgent {
    fn generate_response(&self, prompt: &str) -> String {
        format!("{} is processing '{}' with temperature {}", 
                self.name, prompt, self.temperature)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let agent = LLMAgent {
        name: String::from("Claude"),
        model: String::from("Sonnet 3.5"),
        temperature: 0.7,
        max_tokens: 150,
    };

    let response = agent.generate_response("Hello, AI!");
    println!("Response: {}", response);
}
```

## 3. Tuple Structs and Unit Structs

Tuple structs are struct-tuple hybrids, while unit structs have no fields.

```rust
struct Embedding(Vec<f32>);  // Tuple struct
struct Unanswerable;  // Unit struct

fn main() {
    let word_vector = Embedding(vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3]);
    println!("First embedding value: {}", word_vector.0[0]);

    let _impossible_query = Unanswerable;
}
```

## 4. Struct Update Syntax

Rust provides a shorthand for creating a new instance of a struct using values from another instance.

```rust
fn main() {
    let agent1 = LLMAgent {
        name: String::from("OpenAI"),
        model: String::from("GPT-4"),
        temperature: 0.7,
        max_tokens: 150,
    };

    let agent2 = LLMAgent {
        model: String::from("GPT-3"),
        temperature: 0.9,
        ..agent1  // This syntax copies the rest of the fields from agent1
    };

    println!("Agent2 model: {}", agent2.model);  // Will print "GPT-3"
}
```

## 5. Struct Patterns in Match Expressions

Structs can be used in pattern matching, allowing for powerful control flow based on struct fields.

```rust
fn describe_agent(agent: &LLMAgent) {
    match agent {
        LLMAgent { temperature: 0.0, .. } => println!("Cold responses"),
        LLMAgent { temperature: 1.0, .. } => println!("Creative responses"),
        LLMAgent { model: ref m, .. } if m == "GPT-4" => println!("Latest model"),
        _ => println!("Standard configuration"),
    }
}
```

## 6. Memory Layout: Size and Alignment:Separate Topic

Understanding the memory layout of structs is crucial for optimizing performance and memory usage.

```rust
use std::mem;

fn main() {
    println!("Size of LLMAgent: {} bytes", mem::size_of::<LLMAgent>());
    println!("Alignment of LLMAgent: {} bytes", mem::align_of::<LLMAgent>());
}
```

The size of a struct includes the memory for all its fields plus any padding bytes added to satisfy alignment requirements. Alignment refers to how data is arranged and accessed in memory, which can affect performance.

## 7. Nested Structs and Composition

Structs can contain other structs, allowing for complex data structures.

```rust
struct Conversation {
    agent: LLMAgent,
    history: Vec<String>,
}

fn main() {
    let conv = Conversation {
        agent: LLMAgent {
            name: String::from("Claude"),
            model: String::from("Sonnet 3.5"),
            temperature: 0.7,
            max_tokens: 150,
        },
        history: vec![String::from("Hello"), String::from("Hi there!")],
    };

    println!("Conversation with {}", conv.agent.name);
}
```

## 8. Methods that Take Ownership

Some methods may take ownership of the struct, consuming it in the process.

```rust
impl LLMAgent {
    fn upgrade_model(self, new_model: String) -> LLMAgent {
        LLMAgent {
            model: new_model,
            ..self
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let agent = LLMAgent {
        name: String::from("OpenAI"),
        model: String::from("GPT-3"),
        temperature: 0.7,
        max_tokens: 150,
    };

    let upgraded_agent = agent.upgrade_model(String::from("GPT-4"));
    // agent is no longer accessible here
    println!("Upgraded model: {}", upgraded_agent.model);
}
```

## 9. Associated Constants

Structs can have associated constants, which are values tied to the struct itself rather than an instance.

```rust
impl LLMAgent {
    const MIN_TEMPERATURE: f32 = 0.0;
    const MAX_TEMPERATURE: f32 = 1.0;

    fn is_valid_temperature(&self) -> bool {
        self.temperature >= Self::MIN_TEMPERATURE && self.temperature <= Self::MAX_TEMPERATURE
    }
}

fn main() {
    let agent = LLMAgent {
        name: String::from("Claude"),
        model: String::from("Sonnet 3.5"),
        temperature: 0.7,
        max_tokens: 150,
    };

    println!("Valid temperature: {}", agent.is_valid_temperature());
    println!("Max allowed temperature: {}", LLMAgent::MAX_TEMPERATURE);
}
```

## 10. Advanced Method Implementations

Rust allows for different types of method implementations using `self`, `&self`, and `&mut self`.

### Methods with `&self`

```rust
impl LLMAgent {
    fn get_info(&self) -> String {
        format!("Agent {} using model {}", self.name, self.model)
    }
}
```

### Methods with `&mut self`

```rust
impl LLMAgent {
    fn adjust_temperature(&mut self, delta: f32) {
        self.temperature += delta;
        self.temperature = self.temperature.clamp(0.0, 1.0);
    }
}
```

### Methods Taking Ownership (self)

```rust
impl LLMAgent {
    fn upgrade_and_rename(self, new_name: String, new_model: String) -> LLMAgent {
        LLMAgent {
            name: new_name,
            model: new_model,
            ..self
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This guide has covered the fundamental and advanced concepts of Rust structs using an LLM agent as a consistent example. From basic definitions to memory layout and advanced method implementations, structs provide a powerful way to organize and manipulate data in Rust, making them essential for building complex systems like AI agents.

Understanding these concepts allows Rust developers to create efficient, safe, and expressive code, leveraging the full power of Rust's type system and ownership model.
