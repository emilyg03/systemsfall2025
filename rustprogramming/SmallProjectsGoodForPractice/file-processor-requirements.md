# Parallel File Processor Project Requirements

## Project Overview
Create a thread pool-based system for processing multiple files concurrently with configurable processing rules.

## Core Requirements

### Thread Pool Implementation
1. Must implement a generic thread pool
2. Must support dynamic number of worker threads
3. Must handle task distribution efficiently
4. Must implement proper shutdown mechanism

### File Processing Features
1. Must support processing files from multiple directories
2. Must implement these analyzers:
   - Word count
   - Line count
   - Character frequency
   - File size statistics

### Technical Requirements
1. Must use Arc and Mutex for shared state
2. Must implement proper error handling
3. Must support cancellation
4. Must handle all file system errors gracefully

### Progress Tracking
1. Real-time progress updates
2. Per-file processing status
3. Error reporting with context
4. Processing time statistics

### Output Format
```rust
struct FileAnalysis {
    filename: String,
    stats: FileStats,
    errors: Vec<ProcessingError>,
    processing_time: Duration,
}

struct FileStats {
    word_count: usize,
    line_count: usize,
    char_frequencies: HashMap<char, usize>,
    size_bytes: u64,
}
```

## Bonus Features
1. Support for different file encodings
2. Extensible analyzer system
3. Memory usage limiting
4. Progress persistence
5. Resume capability

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests for thread pool
2. Integration tests for file processing
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Error handling scenarios
