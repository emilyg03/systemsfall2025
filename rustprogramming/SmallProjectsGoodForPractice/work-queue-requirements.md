# Work Queue Project Requirements

## Project Overview
Create a multi-threaded work queue system that can handle dynamic task submission and processing with multiple workers.

## Core Requirements

### Queue Implementation
1. Must support concurrent task submission
2. Must implement priority levels (at least 3)
3. Must support task cancellation
4. Must maintain task order within priority levels

### Worker Management
1. Must support dynamic number of workers
2. Must implement worker health monitoring
3. Must support worker restart on failure
4. Must track worker performance metrics

### Task Requirements
```rust
struct Task {
    id: TaskId,
    priority: Priority,
    payload: Box<dyn TaskPayload>,
    metadata: TaskMetadata,
}

trait TaskPayload: Send + 'static {
    fn execute(&self) -> Result<TaskResult, TaskError>;
    fn cancel(&self) -> Result<(), TaskError>;
}
```

### Technical Requirements
1. Must use atomic operations for synchronization
2. Must implement proper error handling
3. Must support graceful shutdown
4. Must handle worker panics

### Monitoring Features
1. Queue size monitoring
2. Worker status tracking
3. Task completion statistics
4. Error rate monitoring

## Bonus Features
1. Task dependencies
2. Task scheduling
3. Result caching
4. Task retry policies
5. Dead letter queue

## Performance Requirements
1. Must handle at least 10,000 tasks/second
2. Maximum task latency of 100ms
3. Support for at least 100 concurrent workers
4. Memory usage under 1GB at max load

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests for queue operations
2. Integration tests for full workflow
3. Stress tests under high load
4. Chaos testing (random failures)
5. Performance benchmarks
