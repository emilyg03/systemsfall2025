// => Couple of words regarding Systems programming in general

// Programming is hard.

// This is a single core class, which basically can decide your fate as a software engineer.
// All 4 years of study, prepares your to take this most important class in CS ciriculum.

// In my humble opinion, it's importance even higher than Data Structures and Algorithm class.
// Make sure to focus heavily on it. Bring your best game :)


// Note: If you can make it, you can assume that you basically conquered the world of programming
// and LeetCode Easy-Medium problems will look like baby's playground.

// First Stop Always:
// https://www.rust-lang.org/
// Open Source Textbook
// Famous Community The Rust Book the so called THE BOOK
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

Note: Don't write code in your "god"-programming language style and be open-minded:)
